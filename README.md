- 👋 Hi, I’m @prataap
- 👀 I’m interested in using Artifical Intelligence to automate various aspect of our life in general which requires our constant congnitive attention but could be automated based on location, weather, mood, schedule etc. 
👽 I have experience building Web Apps and mostly work on backend design and architecture. My most relevant experience is on building a Business Intelligence and Analytics Platform. 
Languages: python using Django Framework and Java using Spring Boot. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJs because I'm a complete backend developer and would like to be hands-on building a full stack web app.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML based application although I'm open to any project that might be interesting enough to hold my attention longer.
- 📫 reach out to me on twitter @prataapms.
